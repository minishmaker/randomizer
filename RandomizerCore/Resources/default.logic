#Explanation on the required format and features
#
# (-----) : required
# [-----] : optional
# ~ ---- ~ : repeatable
#
# = General =
# The Hash symbol starts comments. Lines that begin with it wont be read by the parser
# RAND_INT is a hexadecimal number set by default.
#
# The available location types are:
#   Music - Used for shuffling music, should not be used for anything else
#   Helper - Lets the logic be reused for other locations; this location type is the only one that does not require an address.
#   Unshuffled - This location type requires an item to be placed on the location - this location will have that item.
#   DungeonEntrance - Used to specify that this location represents a dungeon entrance. Only items of type DungeonEntrance can be placed here. If there are any unfilled locations after placing all DungeonEntrance items, randomization will fail.
#   DungeonConstraint - Used by dummy items to manipulate where other items can get placed in dungeons, only items of type DungeonConstraint can be placed here. If there are any unfilled locations after placing all DungeonConstraint items, randomization will fail.
#   OverworldConstraint - Used by dummy items to manipulate where other items can get placed in the overworld, only items of type OverworldConstraint can be placed here. If there are any unfilled locations after placing all OverworldConstraint items, randomization will fail.
#   DungeonPrize - Used to specify that a location can have an item with type DungeonPrize placed on it, if any locations are left after placing prizes, they will get added to the Dungeon pool.
#   Major - Used to specify that only items of type Major can be placed here. Any locations that aren't filled after placing all Major items will be added to the Any pool.
#   Dungeon - Used to specify that any item with type DungeonMajor can be placed here. Any locations that aren't filled after placing all DungeonMajor items will be added to the Any pool.
#   Any - Used to specify that any item with type DungeonMajor, DungeonMinor, Major, Minor, or Filler can be placed here.
#   Minor - Used to specify that only items of type Minor can be placed here. Any locations that aren't filled after placing all Minor items will be filled with Filler items.
#   Inaccessible - No items are randomized to this location, and it is ignored by logic.
#
# The available item types are:
#   Music - Used to shuffle music. Should not be used for anything else.
#   DungeonEntrance - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type DungeonEntrance. If there are any items left in this group after all DungeonEntrance locations are filled then randomization will fail.
#   DungeonConstraint - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type DungeonConstraint. If there are any items left in this group after all DungeonConstraint locations are filled then randomization will fail.
#   OverworldConstraint - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type OverworldConstraint. If there are any items left in this group after all OverworldConstraint locations are filled then randomization will fail.
#   DungeonPrize - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type DungeonPrize. If there are any items left in this group after all DungeonPrize locations are filled then randomization will fail.
#   DungeonMajor - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type Dungeon. If there are any items left in this group after all DungeonPrize locations are filled then randomization will fail.
#   DungeonMinor - Used to specify that this item can only be placed after Dungeon Majors, and can only be placed on locations of type Dungeon. If there are any items left in this group after all DungeonPrize locations are filled then randomization will fail.
#   Major - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type Major, Dungeon, and then Any in that order.
#   Minor - Used to specify that this item can only be placed on locations of type Minor, and Any, in that order.
#   Filler - Used to specify that this item should be used to fill any unfilled locations after all other items are placed. Items with the Filler type will be randomly chosen for each location left when randomization ends, and items can be chosen multiple times. Increase the number of a specific item in the Filler pool to increase the odds of that item being used.
#
# Items are built up in two different ways:
#   In the item pool, they are - Items.(type).[subtype]:[amount]; (item pool type); [dungeon_id]
#    On unshuffled locations, they are - Items.(type).[subtype]
#
# A location is built up as (name):[dungeon id1]:[dungeon_id2]:...:[dungeon_idN]; (location type); (address); [logic]; [item] (Only applies to Unshuffled locations)
#
# Give a location the dungeon_id: `NoSpoiler` to hide it from the spoiler log
#
# addresses can be written in multiple ways.
# xx-xx-xx needs hexadecimal numbers to make an "area - room - chest id" combination
# xxxxxx a hex number that specifies the precise location.
# xxxx:FirstByte, xxxx:SecondByte, information is in 2 seperate spaces so 2 adresses are required, addresses can be substituded for (external definition name):Define .
#
# !define - (define name) - [value]      : sets the define (define name), its value is set to [value] if it exists.
# `TEST`                                 : places the value of the define TEST in place of this.
# !eventdefine - (define name) - [value] : will write (define name) to "extDefinitions.event", its value is set to [value] if it exists.
# !undefine - (define name)              : unsets (define name) and removes its value if it has one.
#
#
# = Define Logic =
# !ifdef - (define name)  : will enter if (define name) is set.
# !ifndef - (define name) : will enter if (define name) is not set.
# !else                   : will enter if the ifdef or ifndef failed, needs an ifdef or ifndef that hasnt been closed by endif.
# !endif                  : needed to mark the end of an ifdef, ifndef and else blocks.
#
# = Window Elements =
# (window tab) is what tab the element shows up in, can be anything, (setting type) is the type of the setting, either Setting or Cosmetic, (setting group) is the grouping for the setting so similar settings can be placed together on the UI, and(readable text) is the text written next to the element
# !flag - (window tab) - (setting type) - (setting group) - (define name) - (readable text) - (tooltip text) - [default value] : adds a checkbox that sets (define name) if checked, defaults to false unless [default value] exists and is "true".
# !dropdown - (window tab) - (setting type) - (setting group) - (define name) - (readable text) - (tooltip text) - (default value) - ~(readable name) - (define name) - (tooltip text)~ : requires sets of "(readable name) - (define name) - (tooltip text)", each set adds a new entry to the dropdown, the (define name) of the setting will be set to the (define name) of the selected entry. (default value) is the value of the (define name) you want as the default value.
# !numberbox - (window tab) - (setting type) - (setting group) - (define name) - (readable text) - (tooltip text) - (default value) - (min value) - (max value) : a textbox where you can input a number, (define name) will be set to the number that was input, (default value) is the default value to put in the box, (min value) is the minimum supported value, (max value) is the maximum supported value.
# !color - (window tab) - (setting type) - (setting group) - (define name) - (readable text) - ~ [default color R] - [default color G] - [default color B] ~ : adds a color picker, the default color is white if no hexadecimal [default color R/G/B] is set, (define name) is set if the color is changed, (define name)_X is set to the color in set X starting from 0.
#
# = Parser Commands = 
# !replace - (item) - (chance set)                     : replaces all occurrences of (item) with a random spread of items in (chance set), (chance set) consists of 1 or more "Items.(type).[subtype]:[dungeon id]:[weight]" entries split up by ,'s and ended with an ; .
# !replaceamount - (chance set) - (amount) -  (item)   : replaces the first (amount) occurrences of (item) with a  random spread of items in (chance set).
# !replaceincrement - (item) - (amount) - (to replace) : replaces the first (amount) occurrences of any items in (to replace) with (item), the subtype of (item) increases by 1 every time it replaces something.
# !addition - (define name) - (values)                 : adds all , seperated number values in (values) together and sets (define name) to that value.
# !settype - (item) - (location type)                  : set all occurrences of (item) to be of type (location type).
#
# = Location Logic =
# all logic symbols other than , are to be put in ()
# Helpers.a and Locations.a mean the same thing but it helps with showing if a location had an item or not.
# logic can be nested, example:"(| (& Items.a, Locations.b), Helpers.c)"
#
# (item),~(item)~           : an AND only on the base level, "Items.x , Items.y" will need both x and y.
# (| (item), ~(item)~)      : an OR, "(|Items.x, Items.y)" will need either x or y.
# (& (item), ~(item)~)      : an AND, "(&Items.x, Items.y)" will need both x and y.
# (+(value), ~(itemvalue)~) : a count, "(+50, Items.x:2, Items.y)" x is worth 2, y is worth 1, this needs enough x's and y's to reach the value 50.
#~(item)                    : a NOT item, prevents the item chosen from being placed at this location, can only be used for item locations and not helpers.eg: (| Items.a , (&Items.b, ~Items.c))

The only exception is a small section of a dark room lit by a lamp in Temple of Droplets after the lilypad section to reach the Blue Warp, as this is required in the vanilla game. - Yes - YESDARK - 'Yes': Dark rooms may require to be navigated without a lantern. In most setting combinations this is low difficulty, however if Open World is enabled then some sections of Temple of Droplets may require navigation in the dark that are much harder.

!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - EXTENDCAPE - Tricky Cape jumps across water - Medium Difficulty:\n The Cape can be used to make many unintended jumps across bodies of water you wouldn't expect.

The Cape jump to the moving platform in Palace is its own setting.
!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - LAKEMINISH - Minish in Lake without Boots - Medium Difficulty:\n Turning Minish in lake normally requires using the boots to bonk into a tree near the cabin, however that is not the only way of turning minish in lake.\n If Red Fusions are enabled then you can ocarina warp to lake to shrink at the stump located there instead, navigate through the path opened by the crack to reach the island in the middle of the lake where Librari can be found.\n From here you can then jump off the ledge into the middle of the lake.

!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - POWJUMP - PoW 2F is clearable without a Cane - High Difficulty:\n In Palace of Winds 2F is a sequence of rooms that at the end requires the Cane of Pacci to hole jump up to a higher platform.\n However the majority of the floor can be skipped with a reasonably precise jump to a moving platform seen when first entering that floor at the bottom of the screen, this skips all the other rooms on this floor which never have any items.\n The jump can be done either with a known setup to make it completely consistent, or the player can just attempt to jump and land on the platform when it stops moving. - NOPOWJUMP - No - NOPOWJUMP - 'No': Everything in Palace of Winds on the 2nd floor or later will require the Cane of Pacci to reach. - Yes - YESPOWJUMP - 'Yes': The only location in Palace of Winds that will require the Cane of Pacci to reach is the Pot Push Puzzle item drop.
!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - POWPOTOOL - Pot Puzzle without Power Bracelets - Medium Difficulty:\n In Palace of Winds 3F is a section you have to push some pots while minish to reach an item, these pots require the Power Bracelets to be pushed.\n Once you regrow, you then must hit a switch which makes the item drop and a door open. This switch is reachable from a later part of the dungeon, which means the Power Bracelets can be avoided by reaching this later part of the dungeon, hitting the switch, and then backtracking back to the beginning. - NOPOWOOL - No - NOPOWOOL - 'No': Power Bracelets will always be required to reach this location. - Yes - YESPOWOOL - 'Yes': It may be required to reach 3F of the internal section of the dungeon during the 2nd half, located near the blue and red warps. Once the switch has been hit then you can return to the entrance of the dungeon and continue to the item location without having to shrink.

!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - DHCCANON - DHC Canon rooms without Four Sword - High Difficulty:\n In Dark Hyrule are two rooms that require knocking canon balls back at canons to complete a puzzle.\n These two rooms are located near the main entrance of the dungeon, one on 1F found by heading north from the main entrance, the other found on B1 by going down the right staircase from the main entrance.\n The intended method of completing these puzzles is by creating 4 Links with the Four Sword, and then doing a sword slash to knock all of the 4 canonballs back simultanously.\n However, it is possible (with setups and practice) to complete these without cloning but by instead using a well timed and placed bomb and sword slash.\n Despite this being a High Difficulty setting, it is unlikely to be required without Four Sword unless you play on the DHC: 'Always Open' setting. Having Four Sword as a requirement for entering DHC will make this always require Four Sword. - NODHCCANON - No - NODHCCANON - 'No': Four Sword (and a Spin) is always required to clear any canon room puzzle in DHC. - Yes - YESDHCCANON - 'Yes': DHC Canon rooms may require only a sword and a bomb bag.
!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - DHCJOSTLE - DHC Pressure Pads without Four Sword - High Difficulty:\n After the 1F Canon room in the room with the moving blade trap, there are 4 pressure pads that must be pressed to spawn a chest containing an item.\n The intended method to do this puzzle is to use the Four Sword and create 4 Links to stand on these pads simultanously, however it is possible to this with less clones.\n These pads have a slight lag in their detection, which means you can use 2 Links (the amount you get with Red Sword) and make Link quickly walk between 2 pads adjacent to each other for the game to detect both as pressed,\n the clone will mirror the main link and do the same on the other 2 switches to trigger all the pads simultanously and spawn the chest.\n Similar to the DHC Canon setting, this is unlikely to be required unless you play on the DHC: 'Always Open' setting, and will always require Four Sword if one of the DHC requirements is Four Sword.\n This trick is relatively low difficulty to execute, however to reach this area without the Four Sword you must pass a Canon room which will never be required unless the DHC Canon setting is set to 'Yes'. - NODHCJOSTLE - No - NODHCJOSTLE - 'No': Four Sword (and a Spin) will always be required for this location. - Yes - YESDHCJOSTLE - 'Yes': Red Sword (and a Spin) is all that is required for this location. If DHC Canon is set to 'No' then this location requires Four Sword (and a Spin).

!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - DHCSWITCHES - DHC Switches without Four Sword - Medium/High Difficulty:\n In Dark Hyrule Castle 2F are 2 rooms that contain puzzles which require hitting 4 switches simultanously to solve the puzzle,\n these switches are close enough together at each location that a single spin attack from a precise spot can hit all the switches and solve the puzzle without having to create clones.\n However because they are located late in the dungeon behind puzzles that always require the Four Sword, this setting will only matter when playing Open World and going through the red warp to reach this floor. - NODHCSWITCHES - No - NODHCSWITCHES - 'No': Four Sword (and a Spin) will always be required to hit these switches. - Yes - YESDHCSWITCHES - 'Yes': A sword and spin is all that is needed to do these puzzles. If Open World is off then Four Sword (and Spin) are required.
!dropdown - Logic Settings - Setting - Require Tricks - FOWPOT - FoW Pot item early using the Gust Jar - Low Difficulty:\n In Fortress of Winds there are 2 pots that contain items when playing with 'Special Pots', these are located in a dirt filled room in the back right section of the dungeon on 2F locked behind various locked doors.\n However the lower of the 2 pots can be grabbed with the Gust Jar from a much earlier part of the dungeon located in the front right section 2F.\n The pot can accidentally be released inside the wall which makes the item unobtainable, simply reload the room and the pot and item will respawn. - NOFOWPOT - No - NOFOWPOT - 'No': From the entrance of Fortress, this location always requires at least 3 Fortress small keys as well as the Mole Mitts and Bow. - Yes - YESFOWPOT - 'Yes': From the entrance of Fortress, this location may only require the Gust Jar.
